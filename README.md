EvalML is an AutoML library to build optimized machine learning pipelines for domain-specific objective functions.

**Key Functionality**

* **Domain-specific** - Includes repository of domain-specific objective functions and interface to define your own
* **End-to-end** - Constructs and optimizes pipelines that include imputation, feature selection, and a variety of modeling techniques
* **Guardrails** - Carefully cross-validates to prevent overfitting and warns you if training and testing results diverge
