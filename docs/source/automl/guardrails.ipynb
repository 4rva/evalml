    "\n",
    "By default, EvalML performs 3-fold cross validation when building pipelines. This means that it evaluates each pipeline 3 times using different for training and testing. In each trial the data used for testing is has no overlap from the data used for training to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a good baseline approach, you can pass your own cross validation object to be used during modeling. The cross validation object can be any of the CV methods defined in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) or use a compatible API.\n",
