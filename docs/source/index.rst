What is EvalML?
---------------

EvalML is an AutoML library build optimized machine learning pipelines for domain-specific objective functions.

Picking the right machine learning algorithm and parameters is a time-consuming process that relies on a mix of data science intuition and trial and error. EvalML streamlines the process of selecting the best modeling algorithms and parameters, so data scientists can focus their energy where it is most needed.

Combined with `Featuretools <www.featuretools.com>`__ and `Compose <compose.ml>`__, EvalML can be used to create a state-of-the-art end-to-to end machine learning solutions.
